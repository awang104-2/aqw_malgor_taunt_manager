Displays an overlay that can be used to count red zones and indicate when to taunt. Currently only the zone manager is functional.

Installation:
Because the application was created with pyinstaller, there are no additional installation steps besides downloading the repository and launching the executable. The executable is located in the dist folder, under the name "Zone Manager". Launching the executable may require you to allow permission for it; if you don't want to do that, and you have Python, you can use your IDE to run the files or make your own executable using my files. Run zone_manager.py to run the code.
